# Larry D Almeida

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Larry. 

I'm a software engineer whose current focus is to enable [Zalando](https://corporate.zalando.com/en/brand-hub/our-sustainability-strategy) customers to make more sustainable fashion choices. 

Previously I worked at [Zalon](https://www.zalon.de/?gclid=CjwKCAiAl-6PBhBCEiwAc2GOVMI5pcrIfvzglW5mspTS80apcRka5jcE4ALwbx4III8pBi5uPRtvAhoCfOQQAvD_BwE) where I developed web apps to launch and scale a subscription service providing boxes of curated fashion. 

Before that I designed frontend architecture for online retail stores like [Yankee Candle](https://www.yankeecandle.com/) with [Amplifi](https://www.goamplifi.com/).

I particularly enjoy building tools that enable my colleagues and I like to invest time in encouraging psychological safety and cultivating high performance in my team.

Having received valuable insights from great mentors, I share some practical tips on how engineers can grow their own career at [beyondpullrequests.com](https://beyondpullrequests.com/).
